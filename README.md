# Case Studies

A curated collection of anonymized, professional artifacts that demonstrate my approach to **real-world software engineering problem-solving**.

This repository focuses on the *process* of engineering—reasoning, debugging, and risk evaluation—rather than production code.

## Disclaimer

These case studies are inspired by real engineering work I’ve done. To protect privacy and intellectual property, all code has been refactored or converted to pseudocode, and all identifiers (variables, paths, services, etc.) have been renamed. 

In some instances the exact issue has been modified or generalized, but each example faithfully represents the reasoning, tradeoffs, and problem-solving approach I used in production.


## Purpose

To document and share my engineering methodology through real or simulated cases involving:

- Debugging complex systems under uncertainty  
- Evaluating tradeoffs and risks before deploying changes  
- Structuring investigations and documenting findings  
- Writing postmortems and mitigation plans that drive learning  
- Designing safe rollouts, guardrails, and fallback mechanisms  

Each entry highlights not just **what was done**, but **why**. Emphasizing decision-making, system thinking, and reproducibility.

## Writing Standard

Each case follows a consistent narrative format:

1. **Summary:** One-paragraph overview of the issue and its significance.  
2. **Context:** What system, service, or feature was involved.  
3. **Problem Statement:** What symptoms appeared, how impact was measured.  
4. **Investigation:** Key steps, hypotheses, evidence, and tests.  
5. **Decision:** What options were considered and why one was chosen or deferred.  
6. **Risk & Tradeoff Analysis:** Technical, operational, or user-level implications.  
7. **Mitigation & Handoff:** Immediate fixes or follow-up actions.  
8. **Outcome & Learnings:** Observed impact and how it improved process or reliability.

## Commit Conventions

**add** – for new case studies, artifacts, or diagrams
**update** – for edits or additions within an existing case
**refactor** – for reorganizing folder structure or naming
**fix** – for small corrections (typos, broken links, formatting)
**meta** – for README, repo setup, templates, or conventions
**remove** – for deleting old or redundant files


## Disclaimers

- All examples are **anonymized and generalized** to protect any company or client data.  
- No proprietary source code, credentials, or internal documentation is included.  
- Some artifacts are reconstructed or simulated to demonstrate reasoning, not actual production code.
