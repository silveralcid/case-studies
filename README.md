# Case Studies

A curated collection of anonymized, professional artifacts that demonstrate my approach to **real-world software engineering problem-solving**.  
This repository focuses on the *process* of engineering—reasoning, debugging, and risk evaluation—rather than production code.


## Purpose

To document and share my engineering methodology through real or simulated cases involving:
- Debugging complex systems under uncertainty  
- Evaluating tradeoffs and risks before deploying changes  
- Structuring investigations and documenting findings  
- Writing postmortems and mitigation plans that drive learning  
- Designing safe rollouts, guardrails, and fallback mechanisms  

Each entry highlights not just **what was done**, but **why**—emphasizing decision-making, system thinking, and reproducibility.

## Writing Standard

Each case follows a consistent narrative format:

1. **Summary:** One-paragraph overview of the issue and its significance.  
2. **Context:** What system, service, or feature was involved.  
3. **Problem Statement:** What symptoms appeared, how impact was measured.  
4. **Investigation:** Key steps, hypotheses, evidence, and tests.  
5. **Decision:** What options were considered and why one was chosen or deferred.  
6. **Risk & Tradeoff Analysis:** Technical, operational, or user-level implications.  
7. **Mitigation & Handoff:** Immediate fixes or follow-up actions.  
8. **Outcome & Learnings:** Observed impact and how it improved process or reliability.


## Disclaimers

- All examples are **anonymized and generalized** to protect any company or client data.  
- No proprietary source code, credentials, or internal documentation is included.  
- Some artifacts are reconstructed or simulated to demonstrate reasoning, not actual production code.
